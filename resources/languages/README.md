The generated POT template file is not included in this repository. To create this file locally, follow instructions from [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bigboxwc/bigbox-theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to install the project, then run the following command:

```
npm run setup-theme
```

After the build completes, you'll find a `bigbox.pot` strings file in this directory.
